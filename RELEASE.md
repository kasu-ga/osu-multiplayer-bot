> We started this project and the first version of it is already ready, however, you must take into consideration that this is already a stable version or for the most part it should be. If not, let us know immediately and we will do our best to solve it.

## How to use:

As mentioned on the home page, you must download the program, modify the settings and run, however, you must download the file corresponding to your operating system, so that you only download what you really need.

### Versions

Pay attention to the table and download only the file you need.

| Version      | Operating System | Architecture | Baseline |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| linux-x64    | Linux            | x64          | ✅       |
| linux-arm64  | Linux            | arm64        | ❌       |
| windows-x64  | Windows          | x64          | ✅       |
| darwin-x64   | macOS            | x64          | ✅       |
| darwin-arm64 | macOS            | arm64        | ❌       |

If you encounter the error "Illegal instruction" it means that your system does not support some modern features used by the environment used for the development of the program, if so do not worry you can download the `baseline` version of the program, if it does not exist one version, I'm sorry to tell you that there is no solution.
